The scores are the result of comparing an enrolled user's image with that of the same (genuine scores) or another user (impostor scores). The data (biometrics scores set BSSR1) are made available through the American National Institute of Standards and Technologies [(NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/nist-biometric-scores-set-bssr1).

    "In an identification scenario one has a 1-to-many or multi-class classification problem. The performance of such a system is typically measured by the Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) curve. This curve plots the experimental probability that a correct identification is returned within the top-x (x=1, ..., N) ranked matching scores. \n",

    "> the CMC is also related to the FAR and FRR of a 1:1 matcher, i.e., the matcher that is used to rank the candidates by sorting the scores. This has as a consequence that when a 1:1 matcher is used for identification, that is, for sorting match scores from high to low, the CMC does not offer any additional information beyond the FAR and FRR curves. The CMC is just another way of displaying the data and can be computed from the FAR and FRR.\n",

The report should be between 3-8 pages (more pages $\\nRightarrow$ higher score) and should be structured around the posed questions (Q1,...). The text should demonstrate your understanding of the material and, depending on the question, clearly introduce the context, technique, your expectation and interpretation of the results. Do not limit yourselves to just answering the questions. Feel free to add figures and, if needed, some *small* code snippet to clarify your position. **The report should be self contained, the notebook functions as supplementary material only!**\n",
